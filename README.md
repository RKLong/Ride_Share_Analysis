# Ride_Share_Analysis
Challenge 5 - UCB Matplotlib

# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city-type. A multi-line graph was also created to show the total weekly fares for each city type. We were also given the task of making a short summary of how the data differs by city type and how these differences can be used by the ride-sharing company.
